## Optimization by GRASP for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains an implementation of the "Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure" (GRASP) metaheuristic for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the MOSEL programming language.

## Overview

GRASP is a multi-start metaheuristic for combinatorial problems, where each iteration consists of two phases: construction and local search. This implementation applies GRASP to the Travelling Salesman Problem, aiming to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

## Prerequisites

To run this implementation, you will need:

- MOSEL installed on your system. You can download it from [FICO Xpress official website]([https://www.fico.com/es/latest-thinking/solution-sheet/fico-xpress-workbench]).

## Usage

Run the GRASP implementation with the provided input graph or any other generated graph with the same format.

## Output

The program will output the set of nodes in the order that will cost the least.
